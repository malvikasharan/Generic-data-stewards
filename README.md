# Generic data stewards

## What is this project?
This project is an investigation into the roles of generic data stewards in the Netherlands. I - a generic data steward myself - am conducting a survey with other generic data stewards to understand this.
A data steward is a staff member at a research institution who supports researchers with their data management, gives advice, develops tools and policies, and gives training. Data stewards also usually support researchers when writing Data Management Plans, e.g. for grant applications.
Some data stewards work for a certain discipline, others work for researchers of all disciplines. Some data stewards give more generic advice, while others know more about the functionalities of specific analysis tools. I want to understand more about the position of generic data stewards in these processes.
I'm undertaking this project as part of the [Open Life Science](openlifesci.org) programme.

## Who is this for?
Anybody who is interested in this topic: data stewards, policy advisors, researchers, and others.

## How can I contribute?
Great that you want to contribute! I am still looking for data stewards to take my survey. The link to my survey will follow shortly. Participation is entirely voluntary, and this is a project that I undertook on my own initiative and that is not mandated by my employer. You can find out exactly how to contribute in my [Contributing guidelines](Contributing.md). You can also [get in touch](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxozn8C0s3hObYaafc6HVU5TDrRu3V9ObkMmlCxjXHjIl5Nw/viewform?usp=sf_link) with the project lead. I value contributions from anyone who is interested in the topic. Please also read my [Code of Conduct](Code-of-Conduct.md).
