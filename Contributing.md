# Welcome!

Thank you so much for being interested in contributing! My name is Elisa, I am a generic data steward at a Dutch university, and I am leading this project as part of the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) cohort no. 4.
This project is an investigation into the roles of generic data stewards in the Netherlands. I - a generic data steward myself - am conducting a survey with other generic data stewards to understand this. A data steward is a staff member at a research institution who supports researchers with their data management, gives advice, develops tools and policies, and gives training.
